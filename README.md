1. the gradient for the nav bar and Head section. While I like it and it is a nice idea, it may be a little too much blue/off-blue. The gradient is blue, with blue highlighting the current page, and then the text color is a darker blue/teal /green kind of color. It was a little difficult to read at first as the gradient makes the text a little foggy at the bottom of the word kind of.
2. I would recommend having all the flexboxes on a page be the same height before they end up in columns. It looks like you did it for the home page, where every box is the same height. But, the other pages all the boxes are different heights. They don't need to be the same height as on the home page, but in relation to each other on each page.


To fix number 1, I changed the gradient to change to white, instead. This alligns better with the color scheme of the website in general. I also increased the weight of the font on the website in general, making it easier to read the smaller (and thinner) font.
For number 2, I went in and changed all of the flex layouts to grid layouts, along with making sure that the images on the pages were centered in the box.
