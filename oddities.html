            <h3 class="p1">Gen 2</h3>
            <p class="p1">In gen 2, glitches were still abundant, and while some of them were patched out with the new
                games, quite a few still remained. One of my favorite glitches, and the one we will be talking about is
                the cloning glitch. This glitch would allow you to receive a (near) infinite amount of odd eggs as long
                as you continued to repeat the glitch over and over again.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <h3 class="p2">Gen 3</h3>
            <p class="p2">In gen 3, specifically Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, the RNG was broken in such a way that each
                trainer id and secret id combination was mapped to a specific array of frames. This table could, with
                the proper setup, guarantee specific pokemon, and even the shininess of said pokemon. Of course, this
                requires some rather extensive setup, as you have to find both the trainer id and secret id of your save
                file, and find a program that can take that combination and convert it into the array of frames.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <h3 class="p3">Gen 4</h3>
            <p class="p3">In gen 4, there was an exploit that went overlooked by the devs, this was the cute charm
                glitch. This glitch is quite complex and can take some time to fully understand, but at its core, it
                requires the user to have a very low TID and SID, or, have a specific combination of TID and SID, and
                have a pokemon with cute charm at the lead of your party when encountering a wild pokemon. This works
                fundamentally because in the gen 4 games, the cute charm ability forces all wild encountersâ€™ stats to be
                one of 25 different possibilities, and its shininess is determined in this process.
