      <p class="p1">Shiny hunting in the Sinnoh games introduced key innovations. The Poké Radar allowed players to
        chain encounters with the same Pokémon in grassy patches, dramatically increasing shiny odds with careful
        movement and planning. This method became a fan favorite for its potential speed and challenge. The Masuda
        Method also debuted in these titles, where breeding two Pokémon from games in different languages boosted shiny
        chances, making egg hunting more viable than ever before.

      <p class="p2"> While Heart Gold and Soul Silver didnt add any new shiny hunting methods to the game, there were
        still a few things that shiny hunters could enjoy. The masuda method made its way over from the main-line games,
        and the shiny gyrados remained in the lake of rage. One other item that was enjoyed by shiny hunters was hunting
        for the starters. When you would receive your starter, you could see the sprites of all three, and that sprite
        would show if it was shiny or not, masively increasing the odds for the player to find at <em>least</em> one of
        them shiny!
