            <h2 class="h"><i class="fa-solid fa-house"></i>A brief history<i class="fa-solid fa-house"></i></h2>
            <p>Starting in generation 4, a new shiny hunting method would be added to each pokemon game. Sometimes even
                multiple! However, typically, they would not return between games, except for certain staples.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div class="grid-item" id="item2">
            <h3 class="h">Gen II</h3>

            <p>You may be wondering why generation two is on this list, as I said that the first method came about
                in
                generation 4.
                Well... thats because in generation two, its less of a method, and more of an event. In
                <em>specifically</em> Pokemon Crystal, you could pick up the Odd Egg from the Daycare Man. From this
                egg,you roughly had a 7% chance to bag one of seven different available pokemon. It is good to note
                that you could only get one of these eggs per save file without any glitches.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item" id="item3">
            <h3 class="h">Gen IV</h3>

            <p>In generation 4 they added the first shiny hunting method, PokeRadar. This was a monumental leap
                forward,
                as before this, you could only hunt for these shiny pokemon at full odds, which was 1 in 8192!
                With this method, you could hunt the pokemon available on any route, plus a few pokemon that
                are
                unique to the PokeRadar itself. Learning how to properly hunt using this method can certainly take
                some time. But once you get it down, it is actually quite simple.
            </p>

        <div class="grid-item" id="item4">
            <h3 class="h">Gen V</h3>

            <p> Even though there werent any special shiny hunting methods implemented this generation, they added a few
                things that were pivotal moving forward in the franchise. They more widely implemented 2v2 wild battles,
                which aided the player in getting enconters at a faster rate. They also implemnted the shiny charm,
                which doubled the shiny rate for the player.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item" id="item5">
            <h3 class="h">Gen VI</h3>

            <p> This generation added many different things to the already expanding shiny hunting methods. This was the
                generation that had by far and away the most shiny hunting methods so far, and still holds that crown.
